Tensors are basically TensorFlow's version of a Numpy array with a few differences that make them better suited to deep learning. One of the most important is that tensors are compatible with [GPU](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/efficient-gpu-usage) and [TPU](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/tpu)) accelerators. TPUs, in fact, are designed specifically for tensor computations
