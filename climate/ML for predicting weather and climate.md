Why ?

Due to the inherent complexity, these climate models can be inaccurate or computationally expensive to run, especially for detecting climate extremes at high spatiotemporal resolutions.

Applications:
- **Temporal Forecasting**: The goal is to predict climate variables into the future.
- **Spatial Downscaling**: The goal is to learn a mapping that transforms low-resolution outputs of climate models into high-resolution regional forecasts.

Content:
* **APIs** for accessing and navigating popular repositories that host global climate data, such as the Copernicus data store.  
* Identifying **relevant datasets** and providing functionality to preprocess them.  
* **Algorithms** for training machine learning models.  
* **Metrics** for evaluating model performance.  
* **Visualization** tools for both the dataset and predicted outputs.
